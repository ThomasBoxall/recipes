## Ingredients
### Base
* 100g plain chocolate digestive biscuits
* 50g butter
### Cheesecake
* 150g plain chocolate
* 700g full fat soft cheese
* 100g caster sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs

## Method
1. Pre-heat oven to 160C/ 140C fan/ Gas 3. Lightly grease a loose bottomed cake tin or springform tin
2. Put the biscuits into a plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin. Melt the butter in a medium pan. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the biscuit crumbs. Press into the prepared tin and lave to set
3. To make the cheesecake filling, break the chocolate into pieces and melt gently in a bowl set over a pan of hot water, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly. Measure the cheese into a large bowl and beat until soft. Add the sugar and beat again until well mixed. Beat in the vanilla extract and then the eggs, one at a time.
4. Spoon half the cheese mixture on to the biscuit crust, separating the spoonfuls. Add the metled chocolate to the remaining cheese mixture and stir well to mix. Spoon the chocolate mixutre in between the plain mixture. Swirl the top with a knife to give a marbled effect.
5. Bake in the pre-heated oven for about 1 hour or until the cheesecake becomes puffy around the edges but is still very soft in the centre. Turn off the oven but leave the cheesecake in the oven to cool. Chill well and then loosed the cheesecake from the sides of the tin using a small palette knife. Serve well chilled.
