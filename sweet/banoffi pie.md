## Ingredients
* 90g butter, plus extra for greasing
* 90g light soft brown sugar
* 1 can caramel condensed milk
### Biscuit Crust
* 90g butter
* 175 digestive biscuits, finely crushed
### Topping
* 2 bananas
* 200ml double or whipping cream, lightly whipped
* cocoa powder or chocolate curls


## Method
1. Lightly grease the cake tin and line the bottom with baking parchment.
2. Make the biscuit crust (melt the butter in a saucepan and add the crushed biscuits. Stir well to combine then press onto the bottom and side of the flan tin.) then place in the fridge to set
3. Meanwhile, make the filling: put the butter and sugar into a saucepan and stir over a low heat until melted and combined. Add the condensed link and stir until smooth. Bring to a boil over a high heat, stirring. Boil for 1 minute only then pur immediately over the biscuit crust in the tin. Chill for at least 30 minutes, until set. 
4. Peel the banana, cut into chunky slices and arrange over the set toffee base. Spread the whipped cream over the bananas to cover them completely so that they don't discolor. Chill the pue for at least two hours until firm enough to cut (it will keep in the fridge for up to 6 hours). Before serving, sift cocoa powder over the cream or decorate with chocolate curls.
