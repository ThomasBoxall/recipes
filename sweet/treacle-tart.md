2. Wrap the dough in cling film and leave to chill in the fridge for about 30 minutes
3. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and use to line the flan tin
4. Gently heat the golden syrup in a saucepan until melted, and stir in the breadcrumbs and lemon zest and juice. Pour into the pastry shell
5. Bake in a preheated oven at 200C/ 180C fan/ Gas 6 for 10 minutes; reduce the oven temperature to 180C/ 160C Gas 4 and bake for a further 30 minutes or until the pastry is golden and the filling firm.
