## Ingredients
* 50g unsalted butter
* 2 tsp caster sugar
* 75g white flour
* 2 eggs, beaten

## Method
1. Pre-heat the oven to 220oC.
2. Put the butter and caster sugar in a saucepan with 150ml water. Place over a low heat until everything has melted then bring to a boil.
3. Take the pan off the heat, add the flour all at once and beat with a wooden spoon until the dough comes away from the sides of the pan.
4. Leave to cool for 5 minutes then beat in the eggs, bit by bit, until you have a stiff, glossy mixture.
5. Rinse two baking trays with cold water, shaking off any excess so they are slightly damp (helps the pastry to rise).
6. Use two teaspoons, spoon blobs of the mixture onto the baking trays, then place in the oven and cook for about 18-20 minutes until well risen and brown.
7. Remove from the oven and cut a small slit in the base of each s they don't collapse, then allow to cool completely (on a wire rack) before filling.

## Notes
Custard works well as a filling.
