## Ingredients
* 750g Pork Ribs
* 175g BBQ sauce
* 1 Stock cube
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 tsp coriander seed
* 1/2 tsp mustard seed
* 1/2 tsp peppercorn

## Method
1. Put 2 tbsp of the BBQ sauce and the rest of the ingredients into the slow cooker. Add water to cover. Cook on low for 9 hours, until very tender but not completely falling off the bone
2. Heat the oven to 220C. Remove the ribs from the slow cooker (without breaking them) and lay on a foil-lined baking tray. Baste with the remaining BBQ sauce then cook for 20-30 minutes until starting to crisp on the outside. 

## Notes
Worked fine being left on 'Keep Warm' mode for about 12 hours after slow cooking before oven cooking.

Instead of being cooked in the oven, they can also be cooked on a barbecue.
