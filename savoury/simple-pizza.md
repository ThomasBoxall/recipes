## Ingredients
* 225g greek yoghurt
* 225g self raising flour

## Method
1. Combine the ingredients in a bowl to form a loose dough
2. Tip out onto a heavily floured work surface and kneed for 5-10 minutes or until the dough is soft an not sticky. This will require lots of flour to be added!
3. Gather dough into a ball and coat with a thin layer of flour then leave in the bowl while you prepare the topping
4. Roll dough out on a piece of greaseproof paper until about 1/2 cm thick then transfer to baking tray, still on greaseproof paper
5. Form a crust by rolling the edges over the dough
6. Add toppings then cook in a preheated oven at 230C for 10 minutes, or until starting to brown
