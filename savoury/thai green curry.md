## Ingredients
* 200ml carton coconut cream
* 3tbsp Thai green curry paste
* 2tbsp runny honey
* juice of 1 lime
* 450g mini chicken breast fillets (adding vegetables to this recipe is very nice, or even just a vegetarian version is also very tasty using mange tout, asparagus, baby sweetcorn, cherry tomatoes)
* Handful chopped fresh coriander, plus extra leaves to garnish
* 1 red chilli, thinly sliced, to garnish

## Method
1. Pour the coconut cream into a shallow non-metallic dish. Add the curry paste, running honey and lime juice and mix well. Add the chicken, toss well and set aside for 15 minutes (marinate overnight if you wish)
2. Transfer to a saucepan and gently simmer for 12-15 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened slightly. Add the vegetables halfway through. Add the cherry tomatoes towards the end. Add the coriander.
3. Garnish with coriander and the chilli. Serve with rice.
