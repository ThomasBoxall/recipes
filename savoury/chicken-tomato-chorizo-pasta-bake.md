## Ingredients
* 300g dried pasta
* 100g chorizo
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 3 chicken breasts, cut into chunks
* 400g tin cherry tomatoes
* 400g chopped tomatoes
* 2 tsp dried oregano
* 75g soft cheese
* 2 tbsp grated Parmesan cheese
* 150g mozzarella cheese

## Method
1. Heat oven to gas 8, 220°C, fan 200°C. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta following the packet instructions. Drain and set to one side.
2. Heat a large dry ovenproof frying pan on a high heat and cook the chorizo for 3-4 mins, until the oils are released and it starts to crisp. Add the garlic and chicken and fry for 5 mins, to brown. Tip in both cans of tomatoes and bring to a simmer, then add ¾ of the oregano, ½ the basil, the soft cheese and some seasoning. Stir until the cheese has melted into the sauce.
3. Add the pasta and mix well. Scatter on the Parmesan and mozzarella and the rest of the oregano. Bake for 20-25 mins, until golden brown and bubbling. Serve with the rest of the torn basil on top.
