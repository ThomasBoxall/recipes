* 3/4 cup water
* 3/4 cup soy sauce

* 1 cup grated carrot
* 1 onion, chopped

## Method
1. Coat steak in cornflour
2. Add all other ingredients to the slow cooker; then add steak last. Make sure all cornflour gets into slow cooker - if it doesn't then make a paste with a bit of cornflour and water than add that to slow cooker
3. Mix well.
4. Cook on low for 4-6 hours, the longer its cooked for, the more tender it is.
5. Serve with rice (egg fried rice also works).

Can alternatively be cooked on high for 2-3 hours.
